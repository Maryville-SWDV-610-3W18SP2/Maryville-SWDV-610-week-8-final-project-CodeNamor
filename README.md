This file is a solution to the chess problem similar to the 8 queens.
First it will prompt the user for input.
That input will be used to define the size of the chess board. 

Then it will check if a queen can be placed in a spot without being able to attack another. 
Since this checks if the queen is safe, it will call itself recursively in order to find how many different solutions are available for game
boards in the NxN size which is defined by the user input.
